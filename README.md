# Flamethrower with Burning Effect

In this repository you can learn how to implement a flamethrower that damages enemies over time, including applying a burning effect to the enemy.
What's not done in this tutorial is burning the WORLD, but this IS a topic [discussed in the video](https://youtu.be/Qu9qIpyoVK8) where high level guidance on how to implement that is given.
